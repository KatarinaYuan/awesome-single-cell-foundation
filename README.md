## Why creating a repo focusing on single cell foundation models?

The evolution of single-cell biology is intersecting with the advancements of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The rise of foundation models, especially large language networks, suggests potential deeper insights into cellular mechanisms. Anticipating a future where a foundational cell model integrates molecular, spatial, and morphometric details offers a promising avenue for holistic biological understanding. This convergence of technology and biology brings forth exciting opportunities to enhance our knowledge of cellular states and their implications in health and disease.

**Quote from Fabian Theis:** As modern language models enable text generation as answer to a query, we will be able to query a cellular foundation model about unseen, new cell states across health and disease.
